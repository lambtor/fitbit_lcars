# fitbit_lcars
Fitbit clock face essentially built for personal use. First version has minimal settings, but plan is to eventually have predefined "themes" and custom color options.

I do not intend to use this clock face as a revenue stream.  For this reason, I do not expect to provide any customer support for issue investigation or troubleshooting.  I also will not develop additional features for this clock if I don't intend to use them personally.

To put users at ease, and to explain my rationale for how stardate is calculated, I wanted to put all source code here.  This way, anyone who may want to use this clock face will know that no personal data is getting scraped or harvested.

This app would not be possible without leveraging another github repository:

https://github.com/gregoiresage/fitfont

Fitbit's font support is hot garbage, and requires a lot of work to leverage one that's out of the box.
