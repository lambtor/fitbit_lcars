Take screenshots of the flash module you want to use as inspiration, then pull the colors you want by getting their RGB / HTML codes via irfanview or whatever.

The font I used was pulled from www.lcarscom.net - swiss 911 ultra compressed

data accents = half circle, basically. been using a circle but cutting off the section where the pixels start to shrink after the widest part.
header bars are same height as header text
encapsulated text has 1/3 of font height as padding on bottom and triple the bottom's padding on top
horizontal bars transition to vertical at a ratio of 1:0.3 or 1:3 or 1:4 or 1:0.25

encapsulated text: 1/3 the height of the text as bottom padding, 3x that value as top padding

lcars curves
	outside curve, use quarter circle created with diameter of widest part of 2 intersecting lines
	inside curve, use quarter circle created with diameter of thinnest part of 2 intersecting lines
4:1 ratio between thinner swoop bar and fatter one, but 3:1 also acceptable. THESE ARE THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE RATIOS.
